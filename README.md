# Two Cirlces Partnership Analyst Case Study
### December 2024

#### Brief
Two Circles has been engaged by a leading property within one of the North American
sports leagues to create a comprehensive database for ingesting, standardizing, and
modeling disparate datasets. This platform will enable the client to better service their
brand partners and demonstrate the value of these partnerships.

Your task is to model the provided datasets and produce a clean, integrated output that
facilitates seamless reporting.

#### Datasets Provided

Following datasets have been provided:

1. Social Media data
2. Broadcast data

#### Deliverables
The deliverables for this engagement will be broken into two parts:

##### Part 1: Data Modeling
1. Data Ingestion

You will be required to load the data into your chosen SQL editor tool in
order to model the data into a view. If needed, steps on how to load data
into a SQL editor tool can be provided. Please reach out if you need
assistance.

Please address the following questions:

- How did you approach the data-loading process?
- What key observations did you make about the datasets?
- Did you manipulate the data before loading it? If so, how?

3. Data Cleaning &amp; Standardization

After reviewing and loading the data, you notice that there is an opportunity
to clean and standardize the data. 

Please create custom tables or views and walk us through how
you cleaned and standardized the data.

5. Modeled Output for Reporting

- You will need to develop an integrated modeled output that consolidates all
data sets.
- This output should be designed for easy analysis and support a variety of
client reporting needs.
- Explain your logic in building this output.

#### Part 2: Data Analysis

The client is working towards year-end reporting and wants to evaluate their partnerships
and value at the individual and collective partner level. Using your modeled view, please
create visualizations and insights that the client can use for internal reporting and partner
presentations.

This deliverable should be a Tableau Workbook or PowerPoint with no more than 4
slides/dashboards. Tableau screenshots can also be included in PowerPoint as slides.
